# Reference Documents

A collection of documents I like to use when explaining stuff to people. The static website is generated with [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

### To run

```
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

This starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### To build for hosting

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

This generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
